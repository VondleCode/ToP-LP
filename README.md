TOP Project: Landing Page

I'm very excited to be working on my first landing page as a test of everything I've learned in The Odin Project so far. This specific project will be utilising every aspect of HTML and CSS (more specifically, FlexBox) learned so far to build a very nice looking Landing Page. It will also teach me some things I haven't learned yet which I'm excited to tackle.
